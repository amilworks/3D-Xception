3DXception
==============================

This repository consists of a PyTorch implementation of 3DXception, a convolutional neural network for video classification. The code enables users to train 3DXception for problems in video classification, but has not been tested for data outside videos such as volumetric data.

## Prerequisites 

* Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04)
* NVIDIA GPU
* CUDA
* Docker (Recommended)


## Getting Started

There are two routes you can take, but I highly suggest the Docker installation. Why? Because Docker is awesome. Okay, besides that, I have already packaged everything you need to get started with dataloading, visualizing, preprocessing, training, postprocessing, whatever you need, I probably got you.
